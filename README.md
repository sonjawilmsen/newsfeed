 This is an example which was shown in class during the 5th week of the Codaisseur program. Following the example of our teacher we made an newsfeed based on React while using the newsfeed from "The next web".
 
 It was interesting to see how to make use of a newsfeed and combine this with React. I am really interested in the functionality of this, to create more than just a static page and to use data from various resources.
